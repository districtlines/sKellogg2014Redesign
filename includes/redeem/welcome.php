	Thanks for coming to the show and purchasing the Blunderstone Rookery lithograph. Once you enter your code (found at the bottom of the lithograph), you will have the option of choosing either a CD or vinyl version of Blunderstone Rookery. You will also get a download link emailed to you which you can use to immediately download "Thanksgiving" and "Crosses". The email will contain a second download link which can be used on June 18 to download the entire album. Please note that redemption codes can only be used once. If you have any problems with your code please contact <a href="mailto:support@districtlines.com">support@districtlines.com</a> for assistance.
